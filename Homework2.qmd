## Task 1: Basic Vector Practice

Enter in blood pressure data and assign names.

```{r}
pre_trt <- c(120, 151, 125, 126, 115, 132, 132, 129, 134, 139, 
             127, 122, 127, 135, 133, 128, 147, 138, 140, 132)

names(pre_trt) <- paste("Subject", 1:20, sep = "_")

post_trt <- c(127, 145, 135, 122, 115, 122, 123, 126, 126, 129, 
              132, 146, 120, 114, 121, 120, 128, 120, 133, 115)

names(post_trt) <- paste("Subject", 1:20, sep = "_")
```

Calculate change in blood pressure and averages.

```{r}
# Change in blood pressure from pre treatment to post treatment for each subject.
diff <- pre_trt - post_trt
diff

# Average decrease in blood pressure across all patients.
avg_diff <- mean(diff)
avg_diff

# Which patients experienced a decrease in blood pressure after treatment.
pos_index <- which(diff > 0)
pos_index

# Get those patients blood pressure difference.
positive_patients <- diff[pos_index]
positive_patients

# Calculate the average decrease in blood pressure for positive patients.
pos_avg_diff <- mean(positive_patients)
pos_avg_diff
```
